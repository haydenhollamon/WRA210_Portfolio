       <p>The research and persona building aspect of this project ended up being the most difficult portion of this project for me and is something I am looking forward to working on getting better at it moving forward. I decided to go a more informal route for this specific project, deciding to go through specifically the home page of the Depop app and look for pain points that my friends had with it. I had a list of general guiding questions and came up with questions on the spot when I noticed that they started to pick up on something, but I wanted a more articulated answer on. I decided to go in this direction rather than a more formal route because this is an app that I knew we used pretty frequently, so I thought it would be appropriate to have a less structured experience. I believe that I got valuable feedback from this and was able to attack a couple problems from the feedback I was given, for example, both told me that they were overwhelmed while scrolling through the app and thought some elements of the app could be consolidated. From there I moved on to making a persona, which personally was the most difficult part of the project for me personally. I think part of it was that I interviewed two close friends so having to separate the personality of the persona from there personality was difficult for me. Since they were both users of Depop I found myself generalizing the persona based on them, rather than creating a sample user of the product. I did find it enlightening though, as I want to do some personal projects moving forward and having done a persona and receiving some feedback will help me with that moving forward. With the feedback I received in mind I moved onto making wireframes for a new and improved home page for Depop. I noted that the homepage was in fact 3 pages, the explore page, which was meant for discovering new stiles and users, the mydna page which is meant for finding clothing from specific brands you like and in specific styles you like, and the feed page which is meant for showing pieces from accounts you follow. From the feedback I received I decided to leave the feed page alone and focus on the mydna page and the explore page, with the main goal of making things easier to consume. I did this by consolidating the feed like elements on the explore and mydna page into one main feed which shows the users new styles, things they generally would buy, and clothing in their size all in one. Initially I found this challenging because I also tried to include this along with things like “accounts you should follow” all on one page but found that it was an information overload, so I brought back the explore page and included that along with articles meant for discovering the latest news in fashion and trends, along with a section for trending tags on the app. Looking at others projects in the class I was able to see UX in both the physical and the digital world, as well as the intersection of the two. For example, I think it was Harry who did the redesign of the phone number system at his job at a grocery store, which has a technical impact because you’re redesigning the interface of the system, but also has a physical impact because it makes it easier for the user to input their phone number into the system. I think this is a mor obvious example, but it can be applied to virtually any UX project. I think that UX has endless potential, because its main goal is to make the world a better place and there is no shortage of things, we can do to achieve that goal. </p>
