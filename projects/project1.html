      <p> 
        The website (that you are currently on) was a semester long project to create a portfolio in order
        to begin to develop a personal design process while learning the fundementals of HTML and CSS.
      </p> 

      <p>The goal was to create a fun and immersive portfolio to display work, while maintaining and
        communicating personal style.
      </p>


      <h6><a id="process">process</a></h6>
      <p>This site came to fruition in 5 manin steps; gathering inspiration, sketching, wireframing, mockups and finally
        building the website. I found inspiration through three main mediums: other websites, magazines, and things around me.
        I took a lot of screenshots of websites I liked and noted things about them that I liked.
        
      </p>



      <h6><a id="planning">planning</a></h6>
      <p>Next I started quickly sketching what I may want my website to look like, specifically keeping
        in minda layout, and the pages that I want to include in my website, but also thinking about creative choices
        that could be incorproated design, such us a simple animated character or a a portfolio that spills my projects
        all down the page. This was a short process, meant to get my ideas on paper without too much thought with the intent
        of discovering something that I hadnt originally thought of.<br><br> I then made a more formal wireframe on adobe illustrator
        to get a sense of the final version of the website that I was heading towards. I ended coming up with two directions that I saw myself going in,
        one a portfolio spilling all of my projects down the page, and another more traditional layout.
      </p>

      <h6><a id="styletile">style tile</a></h6>
      <p>next I developed a style tile for the two websites (heads up I ended up changing the entire thing). I thought that 
        I wanted something very traditional, minimal, and a little sophisticated. I wanted to include circular elements to make
        the site a little smoother than It was feeling in the wireframes, but I didn't really know where else to go in terms of styling.
        I decided while making the mockups, shown bellow that I wanted to be a little more fun and trendy than I originally intended with this
        style tile, because that is a good reflection of my personality
      </p>

      <h6><a id="mockup">mockup</a></h6>
      <p>Finally, before diving into the build I made the mockups which is where I really honed down on my ideas. I started thinking about conrinuity
        in the design.
