        <p>Hey! My name is Hayden Hollamon, and I am a programmer and designer from Milford, MI. My passions for technology, design, and problem solving are what pushed me to explore this field. </p>
        <p>Iâ€™m interested in telling a story through design and seek inspiration through a variety of things, from interior design and architecture, to music and movies, to fashion and printed media.</p>
        <p>  As I continue through my creative journey, I would like to take what I have learned and and apply it to produce interesting products and interfaces, across many fields, that are first and foremost user-friendly. </p>
